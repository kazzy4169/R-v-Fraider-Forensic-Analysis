CORE LEGAL ISSUE

The central legal issue in R v Fraider concerns:

1. Alleged disclosure violations by the Crown
2. Potential Brady/Stinchcombe violations regarding withheld evidence
3. Chain of custody concerns for audio/video evidence
4. Authentication and integrity of digital recordings
5. Procedural fairness in evidence handling

The defense seeks:
- Full disclosure of all Crown evidence
- Forensic examination of original recordings
- Stay of proceedings for abuse of process
- Exclusion of improperly obtained evidence
