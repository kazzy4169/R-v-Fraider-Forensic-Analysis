# WAVEFORM FORENSIC ANALYSIS - ALL EXHIBITS

## VISUAL EVIDENCE OF RE-ENCODING

All 6 key exhibits analyzed with waveform extraction:

**Exhibit 20003 (Moffitt):** 4.76 minutes - AAC re-encoded
**Exhibit 20004:** 9.11 minutes - AAC re-encoded  
**Exhibit 20005:** 10.63 minutes - AAC re-encoded
**Exhibit 20006 (Holliman):** 6.51 minutes - AAC re-encoded
**Exhibit 20007:** 9.04 minutes - AAC re-encoded
**Exhibit 15000:** 3.60 minutes - PCM uncompressed

## FORENSIC INDICATORS

**AAC Exhibits (20003-20007):**
- Lossy compression artifacts visible in waveforms
- No original metadata preserved
- Cannot identify splice points without originals
- Authenticity cannot be verified

**PCM Exhibit (15000):**
- Uncompressed format
- May be original or forensic copy
- Requires verification against source

## CONCLUSION

Waveform analysis confirms all AAC files are re-encoded copies. Visual comparison with originals required to identify:
- Splice points (edits/deletions)
- Removed content
- Temporal modifications

**Recommendation:** Demand original recordings for expert comparison.
