- Re-encoded from originals (lossy compression)
- No creation timestamps in metadata
- No edit logs provided
- Cannot verify authenticity

**Exhibit 15000:**
- Only uncompressed recording (PCM WAV)
- May be original or forensic copy

**Total recordings identified:** 43 files in 111 directory

## DISCLOSURE BREACHES

1. Crown provided re-encoded versions without originals
2. No edit logs showing modifications
3. No chain-of-custody documentation
4. Missing metadata (timestamps, software used)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Demand original unedited recordings
2. Require edit logs for all modifications
3. Exclude re-encoded exhibits under Evidence Act s.8
4. Retain audio forensic expert for waveform analysis
